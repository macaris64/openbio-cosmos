      "full": "The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) is an extensive database containing gene expression information from samples collected during the short-duration Inspiration4 spaceflight mission in 2021. Given our prior understanding of the genetic basis for cardiovascular diseases in spaceflight, including orthostatic intolerance and cardiac deconditioning, we aimed to characterize changes in differential gene expression among astronauts using SOMA-derived data and curated cardiovascular pathways. Using the KEGG 2021 database, we curated a list of genes related to cardiovascular adaptations in spaceflight, focusing on pathways such as fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism, arrhythmogenic ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiac muscle contraction. Genes were cross-matched to spaceflight-relevant datasets from the Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.40.2, R) with normalization by median-of-ratios, paired pre-/post-flight covariates, and log2 fold change shrinkage using apeglm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as |log2FC| ≥ 1 and FDR < 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Module score analyses were conducted across SOMA cell types to confirm conserved cardiac adaptation genes. A total of 185 spaceflight-relevant genes were analyzed. Statistically significant changes were observed in immune-related cardiovascular pathways, particularly within monocytes and T cells. Persistent upregulation of arrhythmogenic genes such as GJA1 was noted at post-flight day 82. WikiPathways enrichment revealed additional pathways, including focal adhesion, insulin signaling, and heart development. Short-duration spaceflight induces significant gene expression changes that are relevant to cardiovascular disease risk. These changes are mediated largely through immune signaling and transcriptional regulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Findings highlight the need for tailored countermeasures and longitudinal monitoring in future long-duration missions.",

This study investigated epigenetic changes in immune cells following prolonged orbital spaceflight by analysing histone modifications in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from astronauts before, immediately after, and during recovery from spaceflight. Using Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (Cut&Tag) to assess H3K27ac modifications, we identified significant alterations in chromatin accessibility, predominantly involving immune response pathways, gene regulation, and cellular adaptation mechanisms. While some epigenetic changes were transient, others persisted beyond 50 days post-return, suggesting long-term effects. These findings enhance our understanding of immune adaptation to spaceflight and have implications for mitigating spaceflight-associated health risks. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into immune system regulation under high-stress conditions, potentially informing research on immunodeficiency disorders, cancer epigenetics, and aging-related immune decline on Earth.

      "full": "With future manned space projects involving missions of unprecedented duration, multisystem deconditioning induced by spaceflight could seriously affect the well-being and health of astronauts. Safe and easily determined in-flight biomarkers are therefore needed to monitor health status. In this study, we simulated space deconditioning with a 5-day dry immersion (DI) of 18 healthy women and 19 healthy men and evaluated the effects of this protocol on three biomarkers: the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Increases in all three ratios were observed in both men and women, as also observed at the end of a space mission or after exposure to simulated microgravity. These increases were associated with physical and psychological stress in both sexes. Furthermore, our work suggested a positive link between NLR increase and cardiovascular system alteration in women, whereas in men, there would be a positive relationship between NLR, GLR, PLR, and inflammation. Thus, in addition to physical and psychological stress, sex-specific factors could contribute to increases in NLR, GLR, and PLR ratios during DI. As for the increase in PLR, it did not predict the development of long-lasting immune diseases during DI, in contrast to 2 months of head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR), another spaceflight analog. These data show that the NLR, GLR, and PLR ratios are promising biomarkers that deserve further study to determine the relationships between their increase and microgravity-induced deconditioning. These dry immersion investigations are registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05043974 for women and NCT05493176 for men.",

Interoception and heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting parasympathetic activity, are increasingly recognized as predictors of adaptation and health.

Data were collected from 84 participants in four environments: parabolic flight, nuclear submarine, sea survival simulation, and chemical/biological hazard exercises. Interoceptive sensitivity and HRV were measured to identify adaptation profiles using clustering. Baseline data were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) to predict these profiles.

These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning to anticipate adaptation outcomes based on physiological and interoceptive markers.

These patterns suggested that time of day matters, but it was not until the past two decades that the mechanisms and knowledge translation of these rhythms were uncovered. We describe the heart's intrinsic circadian properties and importantly how this leads to regulation of cardiac gene and protein expression, neuroendocrine and vascular rhythms, metabolism, cellular electrophysiology, and cell signaling pathways. Next, we explore emerging themes, including the impact of circadian timing on ischemic injury, cardiac aging, and trends in circadian desynchrony, sex, and interorgan crosstalk. Building on these discoveries, circadian medicine is beginning to reshape clinical care including timing of surgery, chronotherapies, biomarkers, ICU design, novel molecular drugs targeting the circadian clock, the role of the microbiome and time restricted eating, the new field of rest, and the concept of One Health and applications to veterinary medicine. Looking ahead we address new frontiers such as epigenetics, gene editing, and spaceflight. Together, these advances offer a roadmap for how circadian rhythms can be harnessed to improve cardiovascular health and disease outcomes, supporting longer and healthier lives.",

Current hypotheses regarding the etiology of SANS discuss cephalad fluid shifts and venous congestion, which are correlated with elevated intra-cranial pressure (ICP) and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS). These PVS comprise the glymphatic system (GS), a recently discovered network of influx and efflux pathways for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and metabolites in the central nervous system (CNS). Both glymphatic clearance and traditionally understood CSF circulation are affected by sleep-wake cycles, displaying a significant increase in fluid flow during sleep. Natural sleep has been associated with a 60 % increase in interstitial space in animal studies, which likely enhances GS exchange and outflow. Corresponding studies in humans using contrast-enhanced MRI associate sleep with greater glymphatic clearance compared to wakefulness. The sleep problems of astronauts during long-duration spaceflight have been well documented, ranging from sleep disruption and decreased quality to insufficient sleep duration. With recent terrestrial studies providing evidence that sleep deprivation impairs molecular clearance from the human brain, it follows that similar glymphatic dysfunction may arise due to these conditions in astronauts. Thus, in addition to impairing crew member work performance on long-duration space missions, sleep deprivation may exert long-term neuro-ocular effects via decreased glymphatic efficiency and clearance. The adverse impact of the resulting cognitive and visual disturbances presents a major future performance risk to astronauts. This work discusses the existing body of literature regarding the connections between circadian disruption and glymphatic disruption as a potential contributing mechanism for the development of SANS. This association should receive focused attention in future research as a potential risk factor for SANS.

In response, NASA developed countermeasures such as Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) to simulate gravitational loading on astronauts' lower extremities. LBNP, often combined with exercise, has proven effective in mitigating musculoskeletal degradation during bed rest analogs. This opinion paper argues that LBNP's success in preserving bone mass and muscle function in microgravity can be translated to improve recovery after orthopedic arthroplasty on Earth. We draw physiological parallels between microgravity-induced musculoskeletal disuse and the postoperative period following total joint replacement, during which reduced weight-bearing leads to bone density loss around the implant (periprosthetic osteopenia) and muscle weakness. We propose that applying LBNP as a therapeutic adjunct, for example, in daily sessions soon after surgery - could enhance limb perfusion, promote bone remodeling and implant osseointegration, and accelerate functional rehabilitation. We review NASA's evidence supporting LBNP's osteogenic and anti-atrophy effects, outline potential mechanisms in the surgical context (including improved circulation, mechanical loading, and edema reduction), and present a vision for clinical implementation. While acknowledging technical and logistical challenges, we take a polemical stance that leveraging this spaceflight-derived innovation could transform postoperative care in orthopedics.

Using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), significant alterations in tryptophan metabolites were observed under simulated microgravity.

Treating Caco-2 cells with DSS we observed an increase in serotonin, kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid levels in samples exposed to simulated microgravity compared to controls. Furthermore, exposure to simulated microgravity in conjunction with LPS treatment led to a significant increase in quinolinic acid levels. Additionally, in microgravity conditions, when Caco-2 cells were co-cultured with stool samples, an increase of serotonin and tryptophan levels was observed.

Venous blood samples were collected at different time points (baseline, 1 h, and 24 h after parabolic flight) and frozen as serum samples. Initially, Proteome Profiler Angiogenesis Array was used to screen pooled serum samples of each time point for potential alterations of angiogenesis-associated proteins. Additionally, individual blood samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Proteome Arrays revealed an overall decrease of angiogenesis-associated proteins in response to parabolic flight. On the other hand, proteins associated with lipid homeostasis, such as Leptin and TIMP-4, were significantly elevated in response to parabolic flight. Individual analysis of selected proteins solely revealed a slight increase of ANGPTL4 and HSP70 levels 1 hour post-flight, although without statistical significance (p = 0.7705). Nevertheless, 24 h after parabolic flight, ANGPTL4 concentrations in serum significantly decreased compared to the preceding time point (p = 0.0020). Similarly, HSP70 was tendentially elevated 1 h after flight (p = 0.8135), though significantly declined at the end of the experiment (BL vs. 24 h: p = 0.0435; 1 h vs. 24 h: p = 0.0031). No significant differences could be observed in ANG, ANGPT1, TGF-β1, VEGF, and PDGF-AA concentrations at any time point. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to gravitational changes, such as weightlessness and microgravity, may lead to relevant changes in angiogenesis and lipid homeostasis. The upregulation of Leptin and TIMP-4, as well as ANGPTL4 in short-term response to parabolic flight poses a risk to disturbances in lipid metabolism, potentially increasing the likelihood of cardiovascular or hepatic events. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of microgravity and weightlessness on angiogenesis and lipid metabolism to protect astronaut health during prolonged space missions.",

During a parabolic flight, alternating hypergravity and microgravity phases, lasting up to 40 seconds, enable research into ophthalmic changes. In this review, we discuss the application of parabolic flight as a platform to study microgravity-related changes that might impact ophthalmology including intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure, choroidal blood flow, and modified eye movement patterns. We further highlight how these insights could aid our understanding of vestibulo-ocular reflexes and conditions such as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS).

      "full": "With future manned missions that extend beyond low Earth orbit, it would be wise to anticipate all risks to astronaut health, including those relevant to ophthalmology and the ocular surface. Corneal edema has been documented among mice experiments conducted onboard the Space Transportation System mission, STS-133, owing to increased stress response gene expression. A targeted, relevant search of the literature on topics relating to ocular surface and spaceflight was conducted with scholarly databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to July 2024. From our search results we identified 12,742 articles, 485 of which met the scope of our initial literature search criteria. Following refinement, 99 articles were included in our review paper. The most frequently mentioned mechanisms of corneal edema related to spaceflight included contact lens related hypoxia (24%). Regarding treatments for corneal edema, surgical grafts (16.9%) were most common. From our data, central corneal thickness measurements in astronauts with prior refractive surgery showed no significant differences pre- and postflight: right eye mean preflight, 492 µm vs. postflight, 493.3 µm; left eye, 499 µm pre- and postflight. This knowledge may contribute to our understanding of the increased risk of ocular surface symptoms reported among astronauts. This review discusses the current literature on corneal endothelial transport physiology and the detriments of corneal edema to astronaut visual function. We also describe the diagnostic modalities we can apply to spaceflight, such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and offer convenient countermeasures to spaceflight-related ocular surface anomalies. In doing so, we aim to make future missions safer for human exploration. Lee R, Ong J, Sampige R, Panzo N, Memon H, Suh A, Waisberg E, Mader T, Berdahl J, Chévez-Barrios P, Lee AG.

      "full": "The amino acid homocysteine (HCY) has been implicated in the pathobiology of several conditions, including spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)-a collection of symptoms affecting near vision in astronauts. Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunctions are implicated in the pathobiology of SANS. Our objective was to assess how HCY affects BRB/BBB permeability and the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the modulation of such effects. Human brain and retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs and HRMECs) were treated with 100 μM HCY alone or in conjunction with NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 at 1 μM. The assays performed included fluorometric assays to measure cell viability, an enzyme assay for caspase-1, expression of BRB/BBB tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by RT-PCR, and barrier permeability using FITC-dextran. In HRMECs and HBMECs, HCY-induced endothelial monolayer hyperpermeability significantly (p < 0.05). In HBMECs, the effect was attenuated by MCC950 (p < 0.05). Increased Caspase-1 activity was observed in both cell types following the addition of HCY. Following HCY addition, gene expression results denoting barrier damage were observed, particularly that of ZO-1 (p < 0.05). HCY induces hyperpermeability in retinal and brain endothelial cells. NLRP3-mediation in HCY-induced microvascular permeability is prominent in brain endothelial cells compared to retinal endothelial cells.",

We discuss their potential association with Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) and integrate them in a framework that may help explain the pathophysiology. We reviewed literature using the Medline/PubMed database starting in October 2020. Search terms included ocular circulation, hyperopia, serous chorioretinopathy, pigment epithelial detachment, choroidal folds, choroidal thickening, pachychoroid disease, optic disc edema, venous overload choroidopathy. No date exclusions were placed on the search. Articles were reviewed for relevance. Articles relevant to the pathophysiology of choroidal thickening and choroidal venous overload as it applies to SANS were included. Terrestrial venous overload choroidopathy is thought to be due to impediment to choroidal venous outflow, resulting in dilation of choroidal veins, increased choroidal thickness, pigment epithelial detachments, and serous detachment of the retina. Serous detachment of the retina, pigment epithelial detachments, choroidal folds, and thickening of the choroid were identified on in-flight optical coherence tomography testing. Postflight findings include these, as well as globe flattening. During spaceflight, there is a cephalad displacement of both blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This may lead to pathological consequences in the eye. Remodeling of the choroidal venous vortex system may result in continuance of pathophysiological findings after return to Earth, suggesting the best strategy is prevention. Microgravity induced venous overload of the choroid may play a role in SANS pathophysiology, and a venous overload choroidopathy may help explain several SANS features that remain unexplained by an etiology of elevated intracranial pressure.

Subjects completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) and two psychological scales once during the acclimation period, six times during the HDBR period, and twice during the recovery period. During the HDBR period, subjects were required to maintain a -6° head-down position for most daily activities and only permitted to change positions around the longitudinal axis of their bodies. The results demonstrated that subjects' risk-taking behaviors were significantly affected by bed rest, with an increased propensity to engage in risky activities during the head-down stage. In addition, BART scores did not return to baseline when subjects entered the recovery stage. In terms of psychological variables, the results indicated that scores of general self-efficacy and recovery were negatively correlated with BART indicators, while stress levels were positively correlated with risky behaviors. Compared to other psychological variables, the perceived physical stress, including fatigue, somatic complaints, and sleep quality, exhibited the strongest correlations with BART indicators. The findings of this study implied that prolonged exposure to a simulated microgravity environment and confined isolation conditions may have a sustained impact on risk-taking tendencies, with changes in risky behaviors in the head-down state more closely associated with physiological symptoms.

      "full": "We previously published a model of how calcium from resorbing bone can enter and persist in the circulation with consequent precipitation in coronary arteries. The model was based on chronic inflammation as the source of continued bone resorption. We asked whether other forms of resorptive bone loss such as microgravity (disuse) might also be associated with bone calcium accumulation in coronary arteries. We analyzed a de-identified database provided by NASA consisting of 52 astronauts who had flown a space mission around two determinations of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores at 5-yr intervals and bone density determinations in the year prior to and 10 d and 1 yr following a space mission. We found that in 38.5% of the astronauts, their CAC scores changed between pre- and postflight, with 95% of the CAC scores increasing. These astronauts were significantly older than the 61.5% whose CAC scores did not change, although the mission length was not different between the groups. Both groups lost bone acutely but had partial recovery over the year postflight. Due to lack of uniform sampling times, we could not correlate changes in CAC score with bone loss and would advocate for synchronous determinations of CAC and bone density pre- and postflight.

        "introduction": "We previously published a model of how calcium from resorbing bone can enter and persist in the circulation with consequent precipitation in coronary arteries. The model was based on chronic inflammation as the source of continued bone resorption. We asked whether other forms of resorptive bone loss such as microgravity (disuse) might also be associated with bone calcium accumulation in coronary arteries.",
        "methods": "We analyzed a de-identified database provided by NASA consisting of 52 astronauts who had flown a space mission around two determinations of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores at 5-yr intervals and bone density determinations in the year prior to and 10 d and 1 yr following a space mission.",
        "results": "We found that in 38.5% of the astronauts, their CAC scores changed between pre- and postflight, with 95% of the CAC scores increasing. These astronauts were significantly older than the 61.5% whose CAC scores did not change, although the mission length was not different between the groups. Both groups lost bone acutely but had partial recovery over the year postflight.",
        "discussion": "Due to lack of uniform sampling times, we could not correlate changes in CAC score with bone loss and would advocate for synchronous determinations of CAC and bone density pre- and postflight.

Current invasive ICP measurement techniques are unsuitable for austere environments like spaceflight. In this study, we explore the potential of plasma-derived cell-free RNA (cfRNA) biomarkers as non-invasive alternatives to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for ICP assessment. We conducted a secondary analysis of NASA's Open Science Data Repository datasets 363-364, focusing on plasma and CSF biomarkers related to ICP and neurovascular health. An ensemble model combining Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Ridge Regression was developed to capture plasma-CSF biomarker relationships. To address limited sample size, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic plasma-CSF biomarker pairs, expanding the dataset from 29 to 279 samples. The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and validated against real biomarker data. The GAN-augmented ensemble model achieved high predictive accuracy with an MSE of 0.0044. Synthetic plasma-CSF pairs closely aligned with actual biomarker distributions, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing overfitting and enhancing model robustness. Strong correlations between plasma-derived RNA biomarkers and corresponding CSF indicators support their potential as non-invasive proxies for ICP assessment. This study establishes a novel framework for non-invasive ICP monitoring using plasma cfRNA profiles enriched with GAN-generated synthetic data. The approach shows promise for both spaceflight and clinical applications, potentially broadening diagnostic capabilities for ICP-related conditions. However, further validation across diverse populations is necessary, along with careful consideration of bioethical and data security issues associated with synthetic data use in clinical diagnostics.",

One key mechanism is that microgravity impedes the secretion of meibum, the primary contributor to the tear film lipid layer.

      "full": "Telomere biology still remains a topic of interest in life sciences. Analysis of several thousand clinical samples from healthy individuals performed in recent years has shown that the telomere length (TL) in peripheral blood leukocytes correlates with the TL in cells of internal organ and reflects their condition. TL decreases under the influence of damaging factors and can serve as an indicator of health status. The telomere shortening leads to the cell proliferation arrest and is considered as a marker of replicative aging of proliferating cells. A decrease in the TL in peripheral blood leukocytes is viewed as an indicator of organism aging. Recent studies have allowed to formulate the concept on the role of the CST-polymerase α/primase in the C-strand fill in after completion of 3'G overhang synthesis by telomerase during telomere replication. The discovery of the telomeric RNA (TERRA) and its role in the regulation of telomerase activity (TA) and alternative lengthening of telomeres, as well as the possibility of TERRA translation, has provided evidence of the complex epigenetic regulation of the TL maintenance. Analysis of the published data indicates that telomeres are dynamic structures, whose length undergoes significant changes under the influence of damaging factors. TL is determined not only by the chronological age, but also by the exposure to the exogenous and endogenous deleterious factors during the lifetime. A decrease in the TL due to inherited mutations in the genes coding for proteins involved in the telomere structure formation and telomere replication (primarily, proteins of the shelterin and CST complexes and telomerase) has been found in a number of hereditary diseases - telomeropathies. The assessment of TL and TA is of great importance for the diagnostics of telomeropathies and can be useful in the diagnostics of cancer. Analysis of TL can be used for monitoring the health status (e.g., in the case of exposure to ionizing radiation and space flight factors), as well as predicting individual's sensitivity to the action of various damaging agents.

      "full": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle transcriptional processes, but their involvement in spaceflight- or inactivity-induced muscle atrophy remains poorly understood. To address this gap we simulated the space environment by combining microgravity, irradiation and stress in a mouse model. This simulation resulted in the differential expression (threshold set at P < 0.01) of 6191 protein-coding genes (3525 downregulated and 2666 upregulated compared to controls) and 465 lncRNAs, of which 27% were downregulated and 73% upregulated compared to controls. Particularly several previously identified lncRNAs involved in muscle regulation were affected, including H19 (log fold change, logFC: -2.0), Gm29773 (logFC: -1.4), Pvt1 (logFC: 0.63), Kcnq1ot1 (logFC: 0.31) and Lncpint (logFC: 0.86). To determine whether similar changes occurred in humans, we examined the expression of lncRNAs during long-term (3 months) head-down tilt bed rest, a model for microgravity-induced muscle atrophy. We found that Kcnq1ot1 and Lncpint (human homologues KCNQ1OT1 and LINC-PINT) were upregulated in response to simulated microgravity. In addition KCNQ1OT1 was increased in a human 3-D in vitro model of muscle atrophy. These results are the first to demonstrate the involvement of lncRNAs in spaceflight- and severe inactivity-induced muscle atrophy, in particular KCNQ1OT1 and LINC-PINT. Our study provides novel insights into the contribution of lncRNAs to muscle atrophy caused by the space exposome and has broader implications for understanding and combating muscle atrophy in clinical scenarios of prolonged inactivity. Future research can build on these findings to investigate the therapeutic potential of lncRNAs in muscle atrophy. KEY POINTS: The combination of unloading, irradiation and stress led to a significant reduction in skeletal muscle mass and marked transcriptional responses (6191 differentially expressed genes) in the skeletal muscle of mice. The simulated space exposome led to the differential expression of 465 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mouse skeletal muscle. Two lncRNAs upregulated in mice - Kcnq1ot1 and Lncpint - were also upregulated in human muscle after 3 months of bed rest (human homologues KCNQ1OT1 and LINC-PINT). KCNQ1OT1, but not LINC-PINT, was upregulated in a human 3-D in vitro model of muscle atrophy. This study offers fundamental insights into the role of lncRNAs in muscle atrophy induced by the space exposome. These findings have broader implications for understanding and mitigating muscle atrophy in clinical settings, such as prolonged inactivity.",

      "full": "As space exploration becomes increasingly accessible, understanding the molecular and pathophysiological consequences of spaceflight on the human body becomes crucial. Space-induced modifications could disrupt multiple signaling pathways, with significant implications for the functional integrity of cardiovascular, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems, among others. In a recent study, Bourdakou et al. have focused on alterations in gene expression profiles linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) undergoing spaceflight and subsequent postflight conditions. Genes with known associations with CVD and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) oxidative stress regulatory network have been identified to present consistent directional expression changes in both spaceflight and postflight. A computational drug repurposing analysis identified ten candidate agents with the potential to reverse observed transcriptomic modifications in spaceflight-exposed cardiomyocytes. These findings highlight the importance of molecular studies and emphasize the need for integrative, multi-omic research efforts to protect human health during and beyond spaceflight.",
